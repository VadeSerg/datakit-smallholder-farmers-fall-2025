# [Beatrice Liu] - [Challenge 4 - Crop Questions] Analysis

## Overview
Created bi-, tri-, and quad-grams for English questions on:  cattle, tomato, maize, chickens, and no topic to discern most common questions; these can be used by Producers Direct to create FAQ for smallholder farmers.

## Research Questions
- Question 1: What specific question are you trying to answer?
- Question 2: What patterns are you looking for?
- Question 3: What insights do you hope to provide?

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- List the datasets you're using
- Note any external data sources (weather, agricultural calendars, etc.)
- Document any data preprocessing steps

### Approach /  Notebooks: Overview describes steps in greater detail
1. **Step 1**: Data loading and initial exploration
2. **Step 2**: Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. **Step 3**: Analysis techniques applied
4. **Step 4**: Visualization and interpretation
5. **Step 5**: Validation and testing
1.
6. 

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.13.5 
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, deep-language... - full list is in the notebooks
- **GenAI Tools Used**: ChatGPT, Anaconda Toolbox
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Use of Generative AI

### Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: Used for generating code for natural language processing functions in English, translating Swahili tokens into English
- **Anaconda Toolbox**: Used for generating interactive network graphs

### Human Review Process
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and tested for accuracy
- AI-generated insights were validated against the data
- Modified AI suggestions in the following ways: coding errors


## Key Findings
